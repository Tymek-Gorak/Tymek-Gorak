# About me

I'm a 19 year old high school graduate in Poland. I have a few game jams behind me, and am looking to for work in the game dev industry   

💼 Experience:
  
  Professional experience - I spent a while working in a small game development team consisting of ~10 members. Where I was in charge of designing areas and implementing new features.
  
  Other than that, I have participated in a bunch of game jams. Making a variety of projects on a short deadline, while working in small teams. Delegating tasks and designing a coherent vision for the projects.

Here are projects I'm the most proud of (from newest to oldest):

I started making games in Unity (or Scratch and other similar sites, if you want to count that), and currently use Godot as the game engine for my projects. I may be a bit rusty when it comes to Unity, but all the things I learned while using Godot translate into it quite well.
