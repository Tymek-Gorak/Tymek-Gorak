# About me

I'm an 18 year old high school student in Poland. I have one last year remaining before I finish high school, during which I am expecting to have a lot of free time. That's because the amount of hours I am going to be spending in school will decrease, and I never really needed to study at home. 
Seeing how I'll have more time for other things, I think it's a great time for me to gain some actual work experience in game dev. So I am looking for a job or an internship for the Summer which can later transition into a part-time or maybe even a full-time job. In the Summer I can prove my worth and pick up the skills necessary to be able to work in the afternoons after the school comes back into session in September. 

I have participated in a bunch of game jams thus far, and here I uploaded all of the finished projects from them. 

I started making games in Unity (or Scratch and other similar sites, if you want to count that), and currently use Godot as the game engine for my projects. I may be a bit rusty when it comes to Unity, but I'm sure all the things I learned while using Godot translate into it quite well.
