# About me

🎓 I'm a 19 year old high school graduate in Poland. I have a few game jams behind me, and am looking to gain some work experience in the game dev industry, now that I graduated and have a lot of free time.

🎮 I have participated in a bunch of game jams thus far, and here I uploaded all of the finished projects from them. 
Here are the ones I'm most proud of (from newest to oldest):

🍎⚔ [Last Jam Standing](https://github.com/Tymek-Gorak/Last-Stand---game-jam)
👾🩺 [Heal the Monsters! (because somebody beat them up)](https://github.com/Tymek-Gorak/GMTK2023)
🐍🎵 [Snakey Dance](https://github.com/Tymek-Gorak/Snakey-Dance)


I started making games in Unity (or Scratch and other similar sites, if you want to count that), and currently use Godot as the game engine for my projects. I may be a bit rusty when it comes to Unity, but I'm sure all the things I learned while using Godot translate into it quite well.
